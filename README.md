My personal web-site CV
🛡️ Personal Cyber-Suite Portfolio v3.1Project Codename: CYBER-SHELL-UIDeveloper: Antonio RuoccoSecurity Clearance: LEVEL 3Status: [ DEPLOYED / SECURE ]🖥️ OverviewThis repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio. The interface has been engineered to reflect my identity as a Cybersecurity Analyst & Ethical Hacker, utilizing custom UI modules that simulate security terminals, encrypted vaults, and SOC monitoring dashboards.🎨 Visual Identity & System ArchitectureThe portfolio is organized into chromatic and functional "modules" to provide immediate categorization of technical skills and real-time intelligence:ModuleColorVisual ThemePathExperienceGreenTerminal Log / System Journal/experience.htmlCertificationsCyanExpandable Encrypted Vault/certifications.htmlProjectsGreenGit Clone / OSINT Repository/projects.htmlCyber NewsRedGlobal Intel / SOC Dashboard/news.htmlInteractive LabPurpleSplit-View Command Line/index.html (Interactive)LibraryAmberDigital Forensics / Archive/books.htmlContactCyan/RedSecure Transmission Protocol/contact.html🚀 Technical FeaturesInteractive Cyber Range (New): A high-fidelity, split-view simulation environment integrated directly into the dashboard. Features a left-side CLI for command input and a right-side Visual Monitor for real-time data analysis (Nmap scans, SQL dumps, DDoS packet rates).Global Intel Stream: A real-time threat intelligence dashboard that merges international feeds (The Hacker News) and national reports (Cybersecurity360.it) using asynchronous JS and RSS-to-JSON decryption.Active HUD Interface: Implementation of "Heads-Up Display" elements, including Laser Input Scanning and a real-time Data Integrity Bar.Hybrid SOC Architecture: Dedicated section for the Hybrid Network & Incident Response Lab, documenting physical hardware integration (Managed Switches/Routers) with Wazuh SIEM.Secure Transmission Protocol: Fully functional contact terminal integrated via Formspree API, featuring custom encryption-sequence animations.Soft Scanline Overlay: A global CSS layer simulating vintage CRT monitor aesthetics for a high-fidelity "Black Ops" terminal experience.🛡️ Featured Credentials & StackCertifications: Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1), Microsoft SC-200, Cisco CyberOps Associate, L-PIC 1 (Linux Professional).Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Grid/Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6+), RSS API Integration.📂 Installation & DeploymentTo clone and run the system locally:Bash# Clone the repository
