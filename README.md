## 🖥️ Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio. The interface has been engineered to reflect my identity as a **Cybersecurity Analyst & Ethical Hacker**, utilizing custom UI modules that simulate security terminals, encrypted vaults, and SOC monitoring dashboards.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & System Architecture
The portfolio is organized into chromatic and functional "modules" to provide immediate categorization of technical skills and real-time intelligence:

| Module | Color | Visual Theme | Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Experience** | Green | Terminal Log / System Journal | `/experience.html` |
| **Certifications** | Cyan | Expandable Encrypted Vault | `/certifications.html` |
| **Projects** | Green | Git Clone / OSINT Repository | `/projects.html` |
| **Cyber News** | Red | **Global Intel / SOC Dashboard** | `/news.html` |
| **Library** | Amber | Digital Forensics / Archive | `/books.html` |
| **Contact** | Cyan/Red | Secure P2P Transmission Protocol | `/contact.html` |

## 🚀 Technical Features

* **Global Intel Stream (New):** A real-time threat intelligence dashboard that merges international feeds (The Hacker News) and national reports (Cybersecurity360.it) using asynchronous JS and RSS-to-JSON decryption.
* **Interactive Data Vault:** Advanced JavaScript logic for expandable certification modules, providing a deep dive into specific technical sub-skills.
* **Active HUD Interface:** Implementation of "Heads-Up Display" elements, including **Laser Input Scanning** and a real-time **Data Integrity Bar**.
* **Secure Transmission Protocol:** Fully functional contact terminal integrated via **Formspree API**, featuring custom encryption-sequence animations.
* **Hybrid SOC Architecture:** New dedicated section for the **Hybrid Network & Incident Response Lab**, documenting physical hardware integration (Managed Switches/Routers) with Wazuh SIEM.
* **Soft Scanline Overlay:** A global CSS layer simulating vintage CRT monitor aesthetics for a high-fidelity "Black Ops" terminal experience.

## 🛡️ Featured Credentials & Stack
* **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)**
* **Microsoft SC-200** (Security Operations Analyst)
* **Cisco CyberOps Associate**
* **L-PIC 1** (Linux Professional)
* **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Grid/Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6+), RSS API Integration.
