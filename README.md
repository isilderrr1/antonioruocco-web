## 🖥️ Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio. The interface has been engineered to reflect my identity as a **Cybersecurity Analyst & Ethical Hacker**, utilizing custom UI modules that simulate security terminals, encrypted vaults, and SOC monitoring dashboards.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & System Architecture
The portfolio is organized into chromatic and functional "modules" to provide immediate categorization of technical skills:

| Module | Color | Visual Theme | Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Experience** | Green | Terminal Log / System Journal | `/experience.html` |
| **Certifications** | Cyan | Expandable Encrypted Vault | `/certifications.html` |
| **Projects** | Green | Git Clone / OSINT Repository | `/projects.html` |
| **Library** | Amber | Digital Forensics / Archive | `/books.html` |
| **Contact** | Cyan/Red | Secure P2P Transmission Protocol | `/contact.html` |

## 🚀 Technical Features

* **Interactive Data Vault:** Advanced JavaScript logic for expandable certification modules, providing a deep dive into specific technical sub-skills.
* **Active HUD Interface:** Implementation of "Heads-Up Display" elements, including **Laser Input Scanning** and a real-time **Data Integrity Bar** that analyzes message payload length.
* **Secure Transmission Protocol:** Fully functional contact terminal integrated via **Formspree API**, featuring custom encryption-sequence animations upon submission.
* **Terminal Footer:** A persistent system-monitoring footer with real-time status indicators (`AES-256`, `OPTIMAL_STATUS`) and sticky-layout logic.
* **Soft Scanline Overlay:** A global CSS layer simulating vintage CRT monitor aesthetics for a high-fidelity "Black Ops" terminal experience.
* **Multi-Language Engine:** Integrated Vanilla JS logic supporting English (System Default), Italian, and Spanish.
