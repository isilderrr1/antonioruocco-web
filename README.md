## 🖥️ Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio. The interface has been engineered to reflect my identity as a **Cybersecurity Analyst & Ethical Hacker**, utilizing custom UI modules that simulate security terminals, encrypted vaults, and SOC monitoring dashboards. Version 3.2 introduces a **Full-Stack architecture** with real-time cloud database integration.

## 🚀 Technical Features

### 🛡️ Interactive Cyber Range (v3.2 Full-Stack Edition)
A high-fidelity, split-view simulation environment. **Newly upgraded to a Dynamic Cloud Architecture:**

* **Logic Engine:** Integrated with a **Node.js/Express** backend to process terminal commands.
* **Live Database:** Connected to **MongoDB Atlas** for real-time data retrieval (SQL dumps, user enumeration, and vulnerability status).
* **Dynamic Scenarios:**
    * **SQL Injection:** Real-time extraction of hashed credentials from the cloud.
    * **SSH Brute Force:** Dynamic target scanning and credential cracking.
    * **Patching & Forensics:** Simulation of system hardening and log analysis using real database records.

### 🌐 Global Intel Stream
A real-time threat intelligence dashboard that merges international feeds (The Hacker News) and national reports (Cybersecurity360.it) using asynchronous JS and RSS-to-JSON decryption.

### 📟 Active HUD Interface
Implementation of "Heads-Up Display" elements, including **Laser Input Scanning**, a real-time **Data Integrity Bar**, and a soft **Scanline Overlay** simulating vintage CRT monitors.

### 🧠 WINTERMUTE AI Core

An interactive SOC assistant integrated directly into the custom terminal emulator. Powered by the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API via a secure Node.js backend, it provides zero-latency, context-aware responses and dynamic language detection for a highly immersive experience.

### 🔐 Secure Backend Architecture
* **RESTful API:** Clean communication between the frontend terminal and the cloud logic.
* **Security First:** Database credentials are never exposed in the code; anaged via Environment Variables (ENV) on Render for maximum credential isolation."
* **Command Logging:** Every simulation step is logged in a dedicated database for audit and forensics purposes.
