# 🛡️ Personal Cyber-Suite Portfolio v3.1

**Project Codename:** `CYBER-SHELL-UI`  
**Developer:** Antonio Ruocco  
**Security Clearance:** LEVEL 3  
**Status:** `[ DEPLOYED / SECURE ]`

## 🖥️ Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio. The interface has been engineered to reflect my identity as a **Cybersecurity Analyst & Ethical Hacker**, utilizing custom UI modules that simulate security terminals, encrypted vaults, and SOC monitoring dashboards.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & System Architecture
The portfolio is organized into chromatic and functional "modules" to provide immediate categorization of technical skills and real-time intelligence:

| Module | Color | Visual Theme | Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Experience** | Green | Terminal Log / System Journal | `/experience.html` |
| **Certifications** | Cyan | Expandable Encrypted Vault | `/certifications.html` |
| **Projects** | Green | Git Clone / OSINT Repository | `/projects.html` |
| **Cyber News** | Red | Global Intel / SOC Dashboard | `/news.html` |
| **Interactive Lab** | Purple | Split-View Command Line | `/index.html` (Interactive) |
| **Library** | Amber | Digital Forensics / Archive | `/books.html` |
| **Contact** | Cyan/Red | Secure Transmission Protocol | `/contact.html` |

## 🚀 Technical Features
* **Interactive Cyber Range (New):** A high-fidelity, split-view simulation environment integrated directly into the dashboard. Features a left-side CLI for command input and a right-side **Visual Monitor** for real-time data analysis (Nmap scans, SQL dumps, DDoS packet rates).
* **Global Intel Stream:** A real-time threat intelligence dashboard that merges international feeds (The Hacker News) and national reports (Cybersecurity360.it) using asynchronous JS and RSS-to-JSON decryption.
* **Active HUD Interface:** Implementation of "Heads-Up Display" elements, including **Laser Input Scanning** and a real-time **Data Integrity Bar**.
* **Hybrid SOC Architecture:** Dedicated section for the **Hybrid Network & Incident Response Lab**, documenting physical hardware integration (Managed Switches/Routers) with Wazuh SIEM.
* **Secure Transmission Protocol:** Fully functional contact terminal integrated via Formspree API, featuring custom encryption-sequence animations.
* **Soft Scanline Overlay:** A global CSS layer simulating vintage CRT monitor aesthetics for a high-fidelity "Black Ops" terminal experience.

## 🛡️ Featured Credentials & Stack
* **Certifications:** Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1), Microsoft SC-200, Cisco CyberOps Associate, L-PIC 1 (Linux Professional).
* **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Grid/Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6+), RSS API Integration.

## 📂 Installation & Deployment
To clone and run the system locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/isilderrr1/antonioruocco-web.git](https://github.com/isilderrr1/antonioruocco-web.git)

# Enter the directory
cd antonioruocco-web

# Launch the interface
# Open index.html in any modern web browser
Note: This system is optimized for professional SOC monitoring simulation. The new Interactive Lab supports keyboard-based navigation; type exit within the terminal to terminate active simulations.
